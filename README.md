# DATA MOVED? POWER BI SAID 'I CAN'T FIND IT!' 🚨📂

Imagine moving to a new house and forgetting to tell your friends—Power BI reacts the same way when you relocate your data! Here’s what happened:

✅ Initially, I stored data in a folder on my local machine and imported it into Power BI.
✅ Later, I moved the data to a new location.
❌ When I refreshed Power BI Desktop, it threw an error—Data source not found!
✅ The fix? I updated the data source path in Power BI, and everything worked smoothly again.

Lesson learned: Power BI isn’t just about creating stunning visuals—it’s about truly understanding how data connections work and why it’s called a Business Intelligence Machine. 🚀
